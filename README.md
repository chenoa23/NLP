## Projects Overview

# Natural Language Processing Projects  
A collection of NLP projects completed as part of the Applied Artificial Intelligence curriculum at Miami Dade College. These projects demonstrate techniques in text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and multimodal applications using libraries like NLTK, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.

## 1. Preprocessing of Raw Text
- **Purpose**: Clean and prepare raw text data for NLP tasks.  
- **Techniques**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization using NLTK.  
- **Outputs**: A structured and normalized version of raw text suitable for further analysis.

## 2. Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis
- **Purpose**: Perform binary sentiment classification on a labeled dataset.  
- **Techniques**: TF-IDF vectorization, logistic regression using scikit-learn, evaluation via confusion matrix.  
- **Outputs**: A trained classifier with measurable accuracy and F1-score.

## 3. NLP Techniques Using NLTK Library
- **Purpose**: Explore core NLP tools within the NLTK framework.  
- **Techniques**: Named Entity Recognition, POS tagging, frequency analysis.  
- **Outputs**: Processed examples of linguistic features from text samples.

## 4. Buildling a Recommendation Engine
- **Purpose**: Construct a basic content-based recommender system using text data.  
- **Techniques**: TF-IDF, cosine similarity.  
- **Outputs**: Book/movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## 5. DataPipeline.ipynb
- **Purpose**: Build a simple NLP pipeline from raw data to predictions.  
- **Techniques**: Preprocessing, feature extraction, model integration.  
- **Outputs**: Modular pipeline design ready for deployment or scaling.

## 6. Applied AI Multimodal Models
- **Purpose**: Work with multimodal inputs combining text and image data.  
- **Techniques**: Transformers, visual embedding integration, and natural language prompts.  
- **Outputs**: A working prototype that responds to combined visual-textual queries.

## 7. Exploring Together AI to Build a Custom Application
- **Purpose**: Collaborate with an AI assistant to create a unique text-processing tool.  
- **Techniques**: Prompt engineering, interaction design, iterative model refinement.  
- **Outputs**: A semi-automated app created through conversational AI assistance.

## 8. Neural Network Project: Classification, Multiclass Classification, and Regression
- **Purpose**: Develop neural network models for various prediction tasks.  
- **Techniques**: TensorFlow, dense layers, ReLU activation, categorical crossentropy & MSE.  
- **Outputs**: Three functional neural networks for different types of supervised learning.
